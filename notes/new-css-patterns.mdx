CSS will always be my first love. It started by hacking together some styles to hide banners on my Geocities and Angelfire sites. Then it was a way to customize my MySpace page, which was super important in my high school social circle.

- clamp() (text, layout)
- whitespace: pre-line (newline parse)
- display: contents (kinda like asChild)
- color-mix
