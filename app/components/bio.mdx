I came to **New York City** to study **graphic design at the School of Visual Arts**. I stuck around to develop and maintain sites for clients like **Samsung** and **Verizon** at **The Barbarian Group** and **Rokkan**. Then I spent a few years at **Peloton** building **user interfaces** and **design systems**. Now I'm at **Tabs**, helping to build the industry's most flexible B2B billing platform.

In my free time I like to build pet projects for my hobbies. Most recently I created a [frame data app for Tekken 8](https://tekken.lol/). In the past I've created tools for the [shuffleboard](https://shuff.app) and [skee-ball](https://adamfratino.github.io/hybrid-sim/) communities. I also enjoy backgammon, disc golf, and retro consoles.

I've been really into **Storybook** lately, and I was lucky enough to sit down and chat with them about [building Peloton's first design system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXEu_C0hMjY). I also released a Storybook addon to [add responsive columns to your stories](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-responsive-columns) (although it does need an update).
